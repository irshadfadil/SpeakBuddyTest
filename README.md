This project, i try to implements a beautifully adaptive screen using SwiftUI, tailored for a wide range of Apple devices including iPhones and iPads in both portrait and landscape orientations.

Several Key Implemented
1. Responsive Layout Design -> i try to scale proportionally based on screen size and orientation
2. Adaptive Font Sizes -> i try to dynamically scaled depending on screen width and type
3. Adding logic for ScrollView -> Just for iphone orientation landscape, because height too small i do this logic so user can scroll.
